  <h2>Relevant skills</h2>

  <div class="dropdown-content" onclick="">
  <p>My most valuable skills lie in design thinking, research and foresight. I am proficient in the Adobe Suite and am a skilled drawer. I love thinking things through in order to better understand the world around me. Check out my <a href="https://theorichardson.github.io/RealSignals/index.html">website</a> all about behavioural signals that I believe will lead to impactful trends in the future.</p>
